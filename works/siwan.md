excerpt: Siwan, a burgeoning luxury women's clothing brand, hails from the vibrant city of Melbourne, Australia. I was commissioned to craft the artistic direction and devise an identity that encapsulated the client's aspirations. The client sought a minimalist and adaptable design, ensuring its suitability for diverse applications.

The essence of Siwan's identity lies in its elegant simplicity, allowing it to seamlessly integrate into a myriad of contexts. This approach provides the brand with the flexibility to evolve and adapt while maintaining its core vision. The result is a timeless and versatile identity that resonates with Siwan's sophisticated target audience.

The brand predominantly showcases shades of sandy taupe and coral, which were carefully selected to evoke a sense of serenity and comfort, while retaining an air of femininity. It was the intention to communicate warmth that naturally steered me towards the gentle sensation of touch.

This inspired me to create the tagline "Curated by Tomorrow's Touch" as a central element of the brand identity. This phrase can be employed in diverse contexts to not only enhance the overall brand experience but also as a versatile design component that can be printed or embossed on an extensive array of packaging, labels, and materials.
